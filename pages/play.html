                <p>
                    This was the first time I worked with other people to make a game. <br>
                    The game we made was made in unity. <br>
                    In our groupe we had 5 people and each of us had their own tasks to handle. <br>
                    The groupe consisted out of 2 SD'ers and 3 DDM'ers. <br>
                    SD: software developer. <br>
                    DDM: dutch design and motion (in my understanding they make art and can make animations). <br>
                    My task was make everything exept the player, so that includes sound, menu and scene switching. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned that communication is very important. <br>
                    Another thing that is important is feedback, <br>
                    Asking feedback within the team gives you new ideas and gets the DDM'ers more involved.
